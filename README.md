# sightreading
A tool to practice music sight reading.

## Purpose
A tool to run sight reading practice sessions that display a musical staff and a changing series of notes that I would play on a keyboard. The MVP should be a treble clef staff in C Major that shows a blank score on which notes appear every beat. A note appears one beat before it is to be played.

## To Do
- Add metronome sound with higher pitch for lead in
- Increase note range to be from A4 to C6
- Make larger with random title and tempo markers (bpm and ms) and measure lines
- Variable tempo
- Variable note range
- Variable key
- Variable (and multiple) clefs
- Make original music note art
- Make tempo use words instead of numbers

## Questions
- Should the score be fixed in space like it would be on a page, or should the notes move on the screen either choppily or scrolling across?
